/// The operation of a state machine is specified by states, which are
/// represented by structures with the smithy.stateslanguage#state trait,
/// fields in the top-level smithy.stateslanguage#stateMachine$states.
/// 
/// When this state machine is launched, the interpreter begins execution
/// by identifying the state at smithy.stateslanguage#stateMachine$startAt.
/// It executes that state, and then checks to see if the state is marked
/// as an TODO(stateslanguage) End State. If it is, the machine
/// terminates and returns a result. If the state is not an
/// TODO(stateslanguage) End State, the interpreter looks for a
/// TODO(stateslanguage) "Next" field to determine what state to run next;
/// it repeats this process until it reaches a TODO(stateslanguage)
/// Terminal State (Succeed, Fail, or an End State) or a TODO(stateslanguage)
/// runtime error occurs.
